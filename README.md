### Requirements
* Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Discord.py (https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
* Colorama (https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)

**Download Discord.py:** ```pip install -U discord.py``` <br />
**Download Colorama:** ```pip install colorama``` <br />
(Run those in command prompt, only Windows supported as of now)

### Set-up
* Make a Discord bot with all privileged intents enabled. You can search up 'make discord bot how'.
* Download all the files in this repository (except for 'README.md').
* Set up the 'config.txt' file by putting your bot's token in the first line, your user ID in the second line, and then your preferred prefix in the third line.
* You're good to go!

### Tips
1. With the mass channel ping command, if you want to have multiple words in your channel name combine them with the a dash (like instead of 'lmao get nuked' do 'lmao-get-nuked'.
2. Disable community to be able to delete all the channels!

### Debugging
Having trouble? No worries!
* Make sure all the files are in one folder and that no other files are in it.
* Check to see if you are on the latest version.
* See if the 'config.txt' file is properly set-up!
* You can DM me on Discord at 'J0HAN#6805' for any help.

### To-do
1. Compile into a '.exe' file for ultimate ease of use!
2. Make mass channel ping actually effective.
3. Add proxies to bypass Discord's rate limiting, but I'm not that good of a coder so...
