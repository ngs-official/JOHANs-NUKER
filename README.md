### Requirements
* Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Discord.py (https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
* Colorama (https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)

**Download Discord.py:** ```pip install -U discord.py``` <br />
**Download Colorama:** ```pip install colorama``` <br />
(Run those in command prompt, only Windows supported as of now)

### Instructions
* Create a bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications by clicking on 'New Application' in the top right.
* After creating it click on the 'Bot' category on the bar on the left.
* Scroll down and toggle all three switches under the 'Privileged Gateway Intents' heading to enable them.
* Scroll back up and click on 'Reset Token' where you can then copy your bot's token.
* Download all the files in this repository except for 'README.md' unless you really want to.
* Open the 'config.txt' file and put your bot's token in the first line.
* Go to https://discord.com/ and enable developer mode by going to your user settings, scrolling down and clicking on 'Advanced' where you can then toggle developer mode on.
* Exit the settings page and click on your user profile in the bottom left* where you should see 'Copy User ID' at the very bottom.
* Click on it to copy it to your clipboard and put in the second line of the 'config.txt' file.
* Then put your preferred prefix in the last line (the third one) and you can open the 'start.bat' file to start the bot!
* Use the help command to see all the useable commands, as well as some unuseable ones that are still in development.

*The place where you edit your status, switch account, etc.

### Tips
1. With the mass channel ping command, if you want to have multiple words in your channel name combine them with the a dash (like instead of 'lmao get nuked' do 'lmao-get-nuked').
2. Disable community to be able to delete all the channels!

### Debugging
Having trouble? No worries!
* Make sure all the files are in one folder and that no other files are in it.
* Check to see if you are on the latest version.
* See if the 'config.txt' file is properly set-up: your bot's token, then your user ID, and then your preferred prefix each in their own line without anything else in that exact order.
* You can DM me on Discord at 'J0HAN#6805' for any help, don't feel shy!
