# JOHAN NUKER
Easy to use, free, and open-source nuker for you to use!

**Requirements:**
* Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Discord.py (https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
* Colorama (https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)

**Download Discord.py:** ```pip install -U discord.py```
**Download Colorama:** ```pip install colorama```
(Run in command prompt, only Windows supported as of now)

**Set-up:**
* Make a Discord bot with all privileged intents enabled.
* Download all the files in this repository (except for 'README.md').
* Set up the 'config.txt' file by putting your bot's token in the first line, your user ID in the second line, and then your preferred prefix in the third line.
* You're good to go!

**Commands:**
Use the help command in the bot...

**To-do:**
1. Compile into a '.exe' file for ultimate ease of use!
2. Make mass channel ping actually effective.
3. Add proxies to bypass Discord's rate limiting, but I'm not that good of a coder so...
