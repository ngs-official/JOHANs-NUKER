### Tips
1. With the mass channel ping command, if you want to have multiple words in your channel name combine them with the a dash (like instead of 'lmao get nuked' do 'lmao-get-nuked').
2. Disable community to be able to delete all the channels!

### Speed
* 100 channels created in ~20 seconds
* 100 roles created in ~20 seconds
* 100 channels deleted in ~25 seconds
* 100 roles deleted in ~20 seconds
Do note that these times can vary on many factors.

### Debugging
1. Make sure all the files are in one folder and that no other files are in it.
2. Check to see if all the file names are what they originally were.
3. See if the 'config.txt' file is properly set-up: your bot's token, then your user ID, and then your preferred prefix each in their own line without anything else in that exact order.
4. You can DM me on Discord at 'J0HAN#4273' for any help! Don't feel shy.
