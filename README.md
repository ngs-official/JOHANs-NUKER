### Requirements <br />

## Instructions
Important instructions for setting-up the nuker.

* After creating it click on the 'Bot' category on the bar on the left.
* Scroll down and toggle all three switches under the 'Privileged Gateway Intents' heading to enable them.
* Scroll back up and click on 'Reset Token' where you can then copy your bot's token.
* Download all the files in this repository except for 'README.md' unless you really want to.
* Open the 'config.txt' file and put your bot's token in the first line.
* Go to https://discord.com/ and enable developer mode by going to your user settings, scrolling down and clicking on 'Advanced' where you can then toggle developer mode on.
* Exit the settings page and click on your user profile in the bottom left* where you should see 'Copy User ID' at the very bottom.
* Click on it to copy it to your clipboard and put in the second line of the 'config.txt' file.
* Then put your preferred prefix in the last line (the third one.
* Run the 'setup.bat' file to install colorama and discord.py (if you don't already have them).
* Finally, run the 'start.bat' file to start up your bot and start nuking!
* Use the help command to see all the useable commands.

### Tips
1. With the mass channel ping command, if you want to have multiple words in your channel name combine them with the a dash (like instead of 'lmao get nuked' do 'lmao-get-nuked').
2. Disable community to be able to delete all the channels!

### Debugging
1. Make sure all the files are in one folder and that no other files are in it.
2. Check to see if all the file names are what they originally were.
3. See if the 'config.txt' file is properly set-up: your bot's token, then your user ID, and then your preferred prefix each in their own line without anything else in that exact order.
4. You can DM me on Discord at 'J0HAN#4273' for any help! Don't feel shy.
