### Tips
1. With the mass channel ping command, if you want to have multiple words in your channel name combine them with the a dash (like instead of 'lmao get nuked' do 'lmao-get-nuked').
2. Disable community to be able to delete all the channels!
3. Feel free to go into the code and edit what the automatic nuke does!
4. Only Windows is supported right now, if it works for other OSs it's purely coincidental (same goes for Replit).

### Speed
* 100 channels/roles created/deleted in ~20 seconds!
Do note that these times can vary on many factors.

### Debugging
1. Make sure all the files are in one folder and that no other files are in it.
2. Check to see if all the file names are what they originally were.
3. See if the 'config.txt' file is properly set-up: your bot's token, then your user ID, and then your preferred prefix each in their own line without anything else in that exact order.
4. You can DM me on Discord at 'J0HAN#4273' for any help! Don't feel shy.
